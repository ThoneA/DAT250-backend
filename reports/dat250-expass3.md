## Technical problems
I had some issues with linking the frontend and the backend together. Mainly because of the voting, since I had forgotten to add a voting field for each option.

Since there is so much code, I had some mismatch between the frontend and backend field names, for example I used 'text' in the frontend, while I used 'caption' in the backend.


## Links
The API / backend:
