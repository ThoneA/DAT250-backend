## Report for exercise 2

I had allready installed springboot and created this repo in the first exercise, and most of it went well. But I had some difficulity understanding how to download WSL on my windows computer and understanding how it works, which I'm still in the progress of understanding. 

I don't have any pending issues with this assignment.
But when I pushed this almost final version to githup I got a build fail in the action workflow. The reason was because I had most of the Gradle files and all the source code files inside a file. This then made the build not find the files it needded to succeed. Now they have succeeded.
